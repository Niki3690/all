            Mini Rocky Road
          </h2>

          <h6 className="is-size-6 font-medium tracking-tighter mt-3 text-right">
            Our handmade signature milk Rocky Road treats come in 50g packs
            small enough for hampers or younger chocolate lovers. We’ve taken
            some of our best-selling rocky road smothered in quality milk
            chocolate and packaged them up as treats that are just enough for
            one or two to share. Rocky Road is handmade, mostly from Australian
            ingredients, with feature flavours perfect for the whole family.
            Three of our featured flavours are Raspberry and Shortbread, Popcorn
            and Peanut Brittle and our Salted Caramel and Peanut. Each one
            balances salt and sweet, tang and texture, for an all-around
            mouth-gasm bursting with flavour underpinned by a generous creamy
            milk chocolate.

            Chocolate Spoon
          </h2>

          <h6 className="is-size-6 font-medium tracking-tighter mt-3">
            Handmade bite sized 50g spoons of chocolate that deliciously flavour
            a hot chocolate or coffee; these are for adults who love their fix
            of chocolate but want to control how much, and for children who can
            only handle a little sweet treat. In rich creamy traditional milk
            chocolate or with the surprisingly delicate mixture of mint and
            white chocolate, these spoons melt in the mouth or in a hot drink
            and give you the luxury of premium chocolate without the concern of
            eating too much in one sitting.

              Our recipe chef and CEO goes on to say that he “loves chocolate
              because it always helps; whether it’s about happiness or sadness,
              <br /> there’s always a chocolate for every occasion. Unlike every
              other kind of food, chocolate is life. You need to control
              yourself because you can always have another piece of chocolate”.

            <p class="text-center font-medium text-[17px] mt-3">
              Every week our CEO dreams up a new recipe, which is why so many of
              the So Moorish chocolates can only be found here, and why
              <br /> they taste so delicious. In fact, we have to slow him down
              so that we can help our clients keep up with his amazing ideas!!
