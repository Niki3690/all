          The dog evolved from the gray wolf into more than 400 distinct breeds.
          Human beings have played a major role in creating dogs that fulfill
          distinct societal needs. Through the most rudimentary form of genetic
          engineering, dogs were bred to accentuate instincts that were evident
          from their earliest encounters with humans. Although details about the
          evolution of dogs are uncertain, the first dogs were hunters with keen
          senses of sight and smell. Humans developed these instincts and
          created new breeds as need or desire arose.
